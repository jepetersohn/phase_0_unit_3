### Reflection

This was fairly difficult. The exercises themselves weren't so bad, but I definitely need a lot more time to wrap my mind around SQL. While most of it makes sense, there are some syntax quirks that hopefully will get easier with time. I spent a lot of time researching, but I still wasn't able to grasp the material to my expectations. Also, I know it gets harder than this, so I'm still looking for a better tutorial/guide to help me learn.
