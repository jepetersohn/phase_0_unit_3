## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: 

For the top schema (the one to one model) I'm trying to model the fact that a user has many ratings, but that the ratings always belong to only one user. My idea was that if you were a tour guide, you would have rating from each tourist that used your services; therefore, one guide, many ratings. 

For the bottom schema (the many to many model) I'm trying to model the fact that a tour guide has many tourists, and that a tourist can employ multiple tour guides. A tourist can go to many different places, all with different guides, and a guide has many different tourists all the time.
